## About Me

I'm a software developer (and a chartered structural engineer) currently working with `React`, `NodeJS`, `Ruby on Rails` and `Python`/`Django`.   

Inspired by the work of creative agencies, I self-learned `HTML`/`CSS` and `JavaScript` at 13 to design a personal blog, and went on to help friends build a business website using `Flash`/`ActionScript` while studying Civil Engineering. Now, after a decade of structural engineering &mdash; a career I am proud of nonetheless &mdash; I realised that my true passion lies in Tech. I wanted more room to innovate, and thus embarked on a career change to become a software developer.   

Self-driven, self-learning and a recent graduate of software craftsmanship at **[Makers Academy](https://www.makers.tech)**, I'm looking for a role where I can collaborate with awesome people to turn great ideas into exciting digital products.

## Skills   

#### Self-driven  

I believe that I can achieve anything I put my mind to. One of my biggest goals as a structural engineer was to achieve chartered status, which demonstrates an all-rounded and high level of competence in the profession. Early in my career, I was declined a place in the graduate training scheme due to not meeting the academic criteria for chartership. To overcome this, I proactively sought corporate sponsorship to study an MSc, organised CPD activities within my organisation and self-managed my professional development outside the training scheme to become a [Chartered Engineer](https://www.engc.org.uk/ceng) in 2016. Similarly, I am confident in my abilities and resourcefulness to succeed as a software developer.  


#### Fast learner   

At Makers Academy, I picked up programming concepts quickly and helped others to do the same. I've been recognised for teaching my coursemates to debug and solve technical challenges. During the team projects, I was particularly good at understanding `React` and helped to upskill the team by giving a team workshop on it. In addition, I actively mentor members of junior cohorts to help them fare better in the course with some of my lessons learned.   

#### Team player   

I developed the skill of pair programming at Makers Academy. This enabled me to communicate technical ideas effectively with developers from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of experience. As I switched pair partners every day, I trained myself to deal with different personality types, exchanging feedback regularly to improve self-awareness. I also developed software projects collaboratively in Agile teams of 4-6 developers. As the Scrum Master for a number of sprints, I facilitated planning sessions as well as daily stand-ups and retrospectives to keep the team aligned.  

#### Problem-solver   

I built a reputation at [Transport for London](https://www.tfl.gov.uk) for solving construction problems within the [Four Lines Modernisation](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/four-lines-modernisation) programme. On several occasions, cable support systems were either incorrectly installed or could not be installed as-designed due to site constraints. I was able to liaise with design and construction teams, perform engineering assessments and provide solutions quickly on-site, which resulted in substantial team progress with the cable installation.


#### Analytical thinker   

As a structural engineer, I successfully analysed complex problems such as the capacity of offshore structures to withstand extreme waves and accidental blast.  On multiple projects I was able to apply a methodical workflow, leveraging software and scripting for advanced structural simulations, whilst independently verifying and interpreting the result data in order to advise clients on OPEX decisions.

## Experience

**[Energystructures](http://www.energystructures.com)** (April 2016 &mdash; Present)   
**Founder & Engineering Consultant**   


I was responsible for the delivery of engineering and analytical workscopes for oil and gas, renewables and rail infrastructure. Notable clients include [Optimus Aberdeen](https://www.optimusaberdeen.com) (2018-2019, energy sector) and [Transport for London](https://www.tfl.gov.uk) (2017-2018, rail sector).

- I studied the structural behaviour of a ship and a blast-loaded module using advanced finite element analysis software ([Sesam](https://www.dnvgl.com/software/products/sesam-products.html) and [Abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/)) using `JavaScript` and `Python` scripting to automate the analysis workflow.

- I helped energy contractors overcome marine lifting and installation constraints by designing modularised structures that could be transported separately but hooked up as an integrated unit after installation.


**[McDermott](https://www.mcdermott.com/)** (October 2011 &mdash; January 2017)   
**Structural Engineer**    

Working in a team, I successfully delivered high-quality and timely structural designs for the new Mariner, Montrose BLP and Clair Ridge offshore installations in the UK North Sea. I optimised the team's workflow by developing `Excel VBA` macros to automate the screening of analysis results and significantly reduced the manual calculations that followed.

I was responsible for design coordination across teams and third-party interfaces on the Mariner and BP SCPX projects.


**[DNV GL](https://www.dnvgl.com)** (October 2009 &mdash; October 2011)   
**Structural Engineer**   

I carried out 3D computer modelling, analysis and engineering assessments to support the maintenance and life extension of offshore structures. I was also responsible for liaising with clients (energy operators) and working with their personnel on-site in Abu Dhabi and Trinidad to carry out structural surveys.
